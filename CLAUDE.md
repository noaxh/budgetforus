# Budget App

Private budgeting app for Noah and one friend. Live, in real use.

- **Live:** https://budgetforus.vercel.app
- **Repo:** https://github.com/noaxh/budgetforus — its OWN git repo, not the desktop monorepo
- **Supabase:** project `budgetforus`, ref `aeqydektxshybtyjkekp`
- **Full history/rationale:** [NOTES.md](NOTES.md). Read it before proposing anything structural.

## Where this is going

**The app is being modeled on YNAB** — its interface and its feature set. This is the
governing direction. When a choice is ambiguous, the answer is usually "what does YNAB do".
The **"Visual and layout spec"** section of [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) is the governing design
reference: exact tokens, the four Available states, the category table, the Inspector, the
register columns, and the mobile five-tab / desktop sidebar shell. Read it before any UI work.

**The envelope model shipped in v3** (`schema-v3.sql`, 2026-07-15) — `assignments` holds
one row per category per month, and `Assigned`, `Activity`, `Available` and Ready to Assign
all derive from it in `rollup()`. Read the v3 section of NOTES.md before touching that
function: it documents three deliberate divergences from YNAB, and each one looks like a
bug if you don't know it was a decision.

Roadmap from here. A **full YNAB feature audit** (every feature mapped to
have/partial/planned/skip) and the phased build plan live in the "YNAB feature parity" and
"Build plan for the gaps" sections of [NOTES.md](NOTES.md). Read those before starting a
feature. The phases, in recommended order:

1. **Phase A — cheap wins + the shell:** stand up the design system (tokens, the category
   table, the four Available states, the mobile five-tab / desktop sidebar+Inspector shell)
   per the "Visual and layout spec" in NOTES.md, then category groups, flags/color tags,
   hide-amounts toggle, payee autocomplete, CSV export, extra auto-assign modes.
2. **Phase B — targets engine (keystone):** real goal types (by-date, refill-to, sinking)
   replacing the flat `monthly_limit`, plus the yellow "underfunded" state v3 cannot express,
   plus Cost to Be Me. Highest value.
3. **Phase C — richer transactions:** splits, bulk action bar, Money Moves history, and
   *enhancements only* to the already-shipped `recurring` feature (auto-apply, richer
   cadence). Recurring itself shipped in v2 (`recurring` table + the Recurring dialog); do
   not rebuild it or add a second `scheduled_transactions` table.
4. **Phase D — reflect/reports:** spending breakdown, income vs expense, age of money.
5. **Phase E — accounts subsystem (OPTIONAL):** multiple accounts, cleared/working balance,
   reconcile, transfers, tracking accounts + net worth, and credit-card handling. The one
   fork in the road; decide before Phase C (see Open decisions in NOTES.md). May never be
   wanted for a two-person joint pot.
6. **Phase F — standalone/lifecycle:** file-based CSV/OFX import (the sanctioned non-Plaid
   import), loan/debt calculator, Fresh Start, focused views.

Settle-up / who-owes-who stays out unless asked (the shared budget is a joint pot, not split
costs).

Deliberately **not** doing: bank sync via Plaid (costs money, most of the complexity in every
competitor), subscription cancellation, credit score, mobile native widgets, forecasting,
public API.

## Locked decisions — do not relitigate

- **Static HTML/CSS/JS. No build step, no framework, no npm.** Supabase via CDN ESM.
- **`kind` column, never signed amounts.** Income is `kind='income'`, `amount` always > 0.
- **Money is summed in integer cents.** Never float. `0.1 + 0.2` drifts and it shows up
  across a month of transactions.
- **A personal budget is just a budget with one member.** No `kind` column on budgets —
  membership already encodes personal vs shared.
- **No invite UI.** The second member is added by hand in the SQL editor, once.
- **RLS is the only access gate.** No auth checks in the client — the client is not trusted.
- **No column encryption.** Breaks summing amounts, which is the whole app.
- **Glass on chrome only** (header, FAB, sheets), never on content rows. Per Apple's own
  guidance, and because the numbers must stay readable.

## Conventions

- **Ponytail applies**: build the laziest thing that actually works. Mark deliberate
  simplifications with a `ponytail:` comment naming the ceiling.
- Files: `index.html` / `styles.css` / `app.js` / `schema*.sql`. Keep each under 500 lines.
- **Mobile is the primary target.** iPhone, Add to Home Screen. Design phone-first:
  44px minimum tap targets, 16px inputs (anything smaller makes iOS zoom the page on focus).
- **Measure contrast, don't eyeball it.** Translucency silently eats contrast — the glass
  FAB shipped at 3.89:1 before it got caught. AA (4.5:1) is not negotiable on a money app.
- `?selftest` runs the money/date assertions in the console. Extend it when adding logic
  that can be quietly wrong; leave trivial code alone.
- Local dev: `budget-app` entry in `../.claude/launch.json`, port 5620. Never use Bash
  to run a server.

## Gotchas that cost real time

- **Migrations are manual.** The Supabase MCP in `.mcp.json` is pinned to the SONG-RANKER
  project (`pqnfracutqznykuclsss`) and **cannot see this one**. Repointing needs a Claude
  Code restart. So: hand Noah the SQL and have him paste it into the SQL editor. Tell him
  to Ctrl+A first — he has twice pasted a *filename* into the editor instead of contents.
- **"Could not find the table in the schema cache" usually means the migration never ran**,
  not that a cache is stale. Probe the REST endpoint: a `42703` (column does not exist)
  comes from Postgres itself and proves the DDL never executed. Don't hunt for a reload button.
- **Raw-SQL-created tables don't get RLS by default.** The project has the automatic-RLS
  event trigger on, but always verify.
- **Verify RLS actually holds** by fetching the REST endpoint anonymously with the
  publishable key. `200` + `[]` means RLS denied it. Rows coming back means it's off.
- OAuth setup traps (redirect_uri, the silent Site URL fallback, the invisible Client
  Secret) are written up in NOTES.md and in the ruflo `bugs` namespace. Search there before
  debugging auth.

## Keys

- `sb_publishable_…` is **public by design** — safe to commit, safe in the browser, it's
  in the repo. RLS is what protects the data.
- `sb_secret_…` **bypasses RLS entirely.** Never in client code, never in the repo, never
  in chat. If one appears anywhere it shouldn't, say so and tell Noah to rotate it.

## Open items (as of 2026-07-15)

- [x] ~~**Run `schema-v3.sql`.**~~ Done 2026-07-16. A prior partial run had left the budget
      delete policy behind, so the plain script died on `42710` (policy already exists); an
      idempotent version ran clean and `schema-v3.sql` is now guarded (drop-if-exists /
      if-not-exists) so future re-runs are safe.
- [ ] **Run `schema-v4.sql` before (or with) the next deploy.** Adds
      `categories.group_name` and `transactions.flag`, both nullable. The Phase A client
      writes a `flag` on every transaction and a `group_name` on categories, so until this
      runs, **adding a transaction or category errors** with "column ... does not exist".
      Idempotent; paste the contents (Ctrl+A first). Run the SQL FIRST, then push the code,
      so there is never a window where the new code hits missing columns.
- [x] ~~Rotate `sb_secret_…`~~ — done 2026-07-15.
- [ ] **Onboard the friend, then close signups.** Sign-ups are deliberately still ON —
      closing them before the friend registers would lock them out. Order matters:
      1. Confirm their Gmail is a **test user** on the Google OAuth consent screen. It's
         still in Testing mode (an intentional extra gate), so Google refuses anyone not
         listed — which presents as a broken login, not as a permissions message.
      2. They sign in at the live URL.
      3. Authentication → Users → copy their id.
      4. `insert into budget_members values ('<budget-id>', '<their-user-id>');`
      5. **Then** Auth → Sign-ups → disable.

      Until step 5, anyone holding the public key can register an account. RLS still
      blocks their reads, so it isn't an emergency — but one of the three layers is off.
- [ ] Recommended before more building: **use it for a week with real data.** The envelope
      model is demanding and plenty of people bounce off it. Better to learn that from real
      use than to migrate the schema twice.
